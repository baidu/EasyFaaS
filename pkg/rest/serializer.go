	// version from the serialized data, or an error. If into is non-nil, it will be used as the target type
	// and implementations may choose to use it rather than reallocating an object. However, the object is not
	// guaranteed to be populated. The returned object is not guaranteed to match into. If defaults are
	// provided, they are applied to the data by default. If no defaults or partial defaults are provided, the
	// type of the into may be used to guide conversion decisions.
